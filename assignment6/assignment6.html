<p>It would have been nice if I could have changed the ending. Writing manga is supposed to be freeing. But if I was completely free, then I should have been able to change the ending. I could have changed it and said I wanted to go in a different direction. But the fact is that I was tied down to what I had originally envisioned when I was young. And so, manga became a very restrictive art form for me, similar to how the massive powers that Eren acquired ended up restricting him.</p>

<p>The manga ends with you showing the future of Paradis and sort of the cycle of war continuing. Is there no end to the conflict and the cycle you present in the story?</p>

<p>I guess there could have been an ending where it was a happy ending and the war ended and everything was fine and dandy. I guess that could have been possible. At the same time, the end of fighting and the end of contention itself kind of seems hokey. It kind of seems like it’s not even believable. It’s just not plausible in the world we’re living in right now. And so, sadly, I had to give up on that kind of happy ending.</p>

<p>When the last chapter of the Attack on Titan leaked on social media, the ending became very controversial. During that time, many people were upset, few were happy, and the rest were okay with the realistic ending. When agreeing with the ending being realistic, the story itself reflects humanity. A reflection on how people react and treat one another, the different hierarchies of society, and the secrets that are purposely blind eye to citizens. The part when Isayama stated about, “It is just not plausible in the world we are living in right now. And so, sadly, I had to give up on that kind of happy ending.” Many other fans, including myself, see his work of art mimicking the life we currently live in. Especially when history always repeats itself in a different format.</p>

<p>Growing up, in multiple history classes are about errors of what groups and individuals have done to bring down destruction. Then learn about the ways the horrors finally ended. Beside the history books, the bible and the history of the roman empires, history always repeats itself. In the beginning it is calm, the waves heighten and become aggressive, and the waves slowly subside. When the last chapter leaked out, I felt a bit sad and disappointed with how the ending turned out, but I accepted the result knowing it reflected how reality is. It was a bit funny how the author himself did not want to end that way, but I am curious about what his original planned ending was going to turn out.</p>
