<h1>Art Institute Museum</h1>
<h2>Written experience</h2>
</header>

<p>Visiting the Chicago art institute museum and walking through the 20th and 21st Century 
Architecture and Design, there were few artworks that led to questioning and wondering. One 
collection in the exhibition was different artworks presenting how architects and designers create 
a new image of ways civilization could live together along with the idea of innovation reflecting 
the global climate and environment. An artwork by James N. Wines displayed a high-rise 
building, exposing the interior where there are a bunch of homes with a front yard and trees.</p>

<button id="art">Artwork Info</button>

<p id="hidden"> The 
artwork was a vision of how this could be a new way of home properties expanding upwards 
with greenery and a way of flexibility where people can customize their homes. While the 
imagination took over, it brought some questions of what could prevent it from being real. Few 
thoughts were about the natural lighting, the temperature, the greenery, and the safety of people. 
Also thinking about what could happen in case of emergency, how would people evacuate?</p>

<button id="sec">Second paragraph</button>

<p id="third">The second artwork is a film created by Clarissa Tossin display two teenagers cleaning 
the glossy white marble flooring. The idea of the film illustrates the utopian of marble material. 
Highlighting the actions of how modern capitalism exploits the material where it leads to labor 
work. Labor work of keeping the material clean and presentable to maintain the image of modern 
architecture. The second collection I toured through was different artworks displaying the 
exterior and interior of a building in axonometric view. The collection shortly illustrated how 
axonometric drawing is a way to communicate successfully to designers and non-designers to 
fully understand what the artwork is presenting, it is about, and what messages it is sending to 
the viewers. Mentioning how 3d forms are simpler to understand than 2D without having 
captions or questioning the direction at which you are viewing. </p>


<button id="hatch">Summary</button>
<p id="Sum">After visiting, seeing the Arch Gallery, and seeing the importance of how axonometric 
diagrams can communicate with non-designers. From reading and observing the posters, it made 
me think further of how I can graphically display my project. Especially how the topic of 
diagrams being able to tell a story and how to give out information brought me back to the 
discussions from Narrative studio class.</p>
