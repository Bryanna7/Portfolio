<p>The fictitious truth I am interested in is how the folklore of the black dog works with the Secret Society. In Mexico, the black dog is called as the Nahual. The Nahual is known as a black dog who is an evil spirit that can jump into people’s bodies and possess them. After searching more about the black dog, in Europe the black dog is also known for being an evil spirit bringing misfortune, like the black cat. Hearing the most known stories about there is always a hidden secret society controlling the world, and learning religion is one of them, I can believe how the story about the black dog collaborates with them. The black dog haunts and scares people to keep the people faith alive and active towards one of the following religions. Not only do the black dog scares people, but they can possess people and gain information to their benefit, making sure their mission of controlling the world continues correctly. </p>

<p>There are many videos where people accidentally witness or are caught on tape where the nahuals are walking around, hanging around, and people who are possessed by them. Many videos take place at night where the nahuals can run around and easily take over people bodies with less witnesses and no human activity around. There are also a few websites about the existence of secret society that are public known around the world, however no one in the world knows exactly who those leaders or members are. One factor in controlling the world is religion, and it is used for personal and political reasons for their own benefits. There has been no video or document corrections about the hidden society that collaborates with the spirits, but it is well known that cults have been actively happening and documented into series, documentaries, and people who secretly record what is happening within the church.</p> 

<p>The project can help open many people’s minds and widen their perspective of not allowing false negativity and fear to control their own beliefs. Allowing them not to be manipulated by their beliefs, not allowing them to be controlled and ruined by something that is good. </p>
