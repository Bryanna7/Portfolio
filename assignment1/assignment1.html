<p>The article named <em>404 page not found</em> written by Kate Wagner highlights many points about internet. From mentioning about the evolution to how during this timeline is being used now. Reading the article, it is intriguing how the internet is seen as a gateway of freedom. Freedom is in search of any knowledge of the user’s desire. However, the internet also has some concerning factors. Yes, people can share information on it, but it does not mean all information is meant to be public. Kate illustrated people’s concerns about the dangers of the internet, stating, “be careful what you post online because it’ll be there forever.” Many people are always wary of their data and history being collected. At times when you believe you delete something, the feeling lingers telling you it is not officially gone. </p>

<p>Moving on to the next topic, Kate illustrates during the mid-2000s many content creators, consumers, and participates are becoming active due to new variety and complex websites. Comparing the difference of web 1.0 “required users to manually code, design, and manage their own spaces on the net…” to the web 2.0 “…the proliferation of newly interactive but rather solipsistic media…” On the web 2.0, Kate stated, “…encourage amateur web population to upload, share, record, and participates at increasing rates.” Living through the times of the mid-2000s, the internet did change a lot. From everyone wanting to be on the web, contact, and personalize their profile space to now just simply wanting to be an app where it has limited amount personalization and creativity. While also I and other users are growing up, so is the internet too. The web and apps will be known and popularized but soon few will slowly start to be forgotten. In other words, they are outdated. </p> 

<p>From the mentions of web and apps, Kate said few words about the old and new and status.  The author displayed the populated app of today’s timeline, Facebook, and how it was portrayed with such high status compared to the web. Explaining how a minimalist and lack of personality app can have so much attention away from a web where you can highly personalize to your own interest. Investors and companies came into play. As many companies see how the increasing variety of apps are a gateway to easy access for users and the evolution of smartphones than opening the internet and typing out a website, it was a clear understanding that the apps seemed more sufficient and favored. However, before the introduction of apps furthermore, Kate brought the attention of “class divisions inherent to certain social media platforms.” Kate further explains the details of what by means class division is social class along with racial lines. Kate quoted, “One teen, for instance, called Myspace a “ghetto,” and another described a Facebook as “the place where the ‘honor kids’ got together…” Reading that part, it brought many questioning thoughts of it was viewed in a negative way, but until I read the next sentence, I learned Facebook was introduced to the big league colleges first. As for parents who are concerned about their children being exposed to the negative and dark side of the website, from the article, it seemed to ease many parents’ worries due to the fact Facebook was under school surveillance. As the focal point of the web being a gateway to creativity, Facebook was a gateway to limited expression and now where users’ privacy no longer exists. </p>

<p>Lastly, there is a lot more information I question and wonder but I am going to leave it for now. Growing up with in the mid-2000s, one that has grasped my attention was the introduction of Facebook. It is strange how back then it was seen as high-class, high-status users can access to. Until now it is seen as a medium where specifically elders are using the app more.</p>
